    <name>Accepting Game</name>
    <description>Two improvisers play a scene where one of them is limited in dialogue. The limited improviser can only say one of the following three lines, &quot;Sounds good to me!&quot;, &quot;I&apos;ll go along with that!&quot;, and &quot;O.K., great!&quot;. The unlimited improviser makes offers and the limited improviser replies. The choices made should be active ones allowing for limited responses. This game is excellent if you are not in the mood to improvise. You can be active in the scene without blocking or wimping on an idea.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant>This game can be easily played with an audience member in the role with only three lines.</variant>

    <name>Advance and Expand</name>
    <description>A very simple game. Perform an action, and then make it more interesting. Keep the action simple, and be strict. Have someone offstage call &quot;Advance&quot;, at which point the improviser may advance the story, and &quot;Expand&quot;, at which point the improviser must make whatever they are doing more interesting. Example, if the action is &quot;scratching your nose&quot;, you need to make that activity more interesting. You can&apos;t blow your nose, because that would change the action. You need to make &quot;scratching your nose&quot; more interesting.</description>

    <description>A rectangular area is marked off with chairs or tape, etc. Two improvisers stand at opposite ends of the area. One is blindfolded. An obstacle course of improvisers, chairs, and props is assembled in the area. The sighted improviser guides the other through the course without touching any of the obstacles. Three touches and the game is over. It is good to have a time limit on this exercise.</description>

    <description>Improvisers perform a two-minute, four-person scene. At the end of the two minutes, one person needs to have been excluded from the rest of the group. This game used to be called Exclusion, but that name doesn’t fit the game. The object of this scene is not to exclude someone else, but to align oneself with the others. If you have an ally with you, you can&apos;t be excluded. If you are the one being excluded - don&apos;t fight it -be excluded. The challenge is in trying to get an ally to join you. It is best to keep this scene physical and very specific.</description>

Example: if 3 people are initially in the scene, you might get 2 attitudes from the audience (&quot;impressed&quot; and &quot;indignant&quot;). Then, each improviser plays the scene &quot;in neutral&quot; - endowing the other actors with one of the attitudes. Each actor will react indignantly towards one person&apos;s comments and impressed with the other. Each actor may assign different attitudes to different characters.</description>

If not, Improviser B puts Improviser A back into a neutral position, and Improviser A says &quot;Thank You.&quot; Don&apos;t force the justifications; let them come. The idea is to build up a visual vocabulary. It&apos;s not abstract. You want to train the eye to “see”, not to come up with clever justifications. The more you do this exercise, the easier it will be to justify the positions.</description>

Example; A: &quot;Too bad you don&apos;t have the ability to fly!&quot; or, &quot;Too bad, your gun is out of bullets.&quot; Take your time with this exercise and try it a lot.</description>

    <name>Drawing Game</name>
    <description>Two people sit at a large drawing surface with two different colored pens. They start to draw a line at a time beginning with the eyes, to avoid the abstract. Nobody is in charge, just draw, you are sharing the drawing and bypassing your personality. When the drawing is finished title it one letter at a time.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant name="Automatic Writing">Take a blank piece of paper and a pen. Look in the upper left hand corner of the paper and write down the letter you &quot;see&quot; there, then the next, and the next, and so on. Always “look” for the letter in the blank next the letter you just wrote. When you’re done read the page. This allows things to come out you, you don&apos;t need to &quot;think&quot; about the letters, just write them down. Think of it as being given the letter, as opposed to creating the letter.</variant>

    <name>Chain Murder Endowment</name>
    <description>The scene is played in Gibberish. One improviser remains on stage; the rest of the team leaves the playing area. The on stage improviser asks for 1) an occupation, 2) a room in a house or building, 3) an object, not considered dangerous which will be used in the scene as a murder weapon. The actors are brought back into the playing area. In gibberish, the on stage improviser endows off stage improviser #1 with the three pieces of information. When the endowing improviser is convinced that the endowed improviser knows what the weapon is, he should be killed by it. Then improviser 2 communicates the information to improviser 3 and finally, 3 to 4. The MC then asks the final improviser what the three pieces of information were. Score is not effected by correct or incorrect answers. Remember that the scene is timed, usually with one minute per off stage improviser. The object is to get all the improvisers through in the allotted time (usually 3 minutes). There is nothing wrong with improvisers REPEATING EXACTLY the actions from the previous improviser. The audience is encouraged to applaud each time the improviser correctly &quot;identifies&quot; the piece of information being transmitted.</description>

    <name>Freeze Tag</name>
    <description>Two improvisers begin a scene. An off stager improviser, at some point, shouts out &quot;Freeze.&quot; The on stage improvisers freeze. The off stage caller then jumps on stage, taps one of the improvisers out of the scene, assumes that persons EXACT PHYSICAL POSITION, and begins a new scene based on the physical positions. Improvisers may freeze in and out as much as they like. In order to make this game work, the on stage improvisers should be as physical as possible. This gives the off stage improvisers a greater number of possible Freeze moments.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant name="Blind Freeze">Improvisers have their backs to the action and their ears plugged, an improviser shouts freeze, the next person in line jumps on stage, then, the same as above.</variant>
        <variant name="Location Tag">Same as Freeze Tag except the audience suggests a new location with each freeze that the improvisers must justify.</variant>
        <variant name="One Act Tag">Like freeze tag, except that the improvisers play one character throughout the tag. Every time an improviser tags in, they play the same character. Eventually, the scene takes on a &quot;Soap Opera&quot; quality. Remember to justify the position, as well as the relationship each time.</variant>

    <description>Two playing spaces are defined with a &quot;neutral corridor&quot; between them. Improviser A walks from the neutral corridor into one of the spaces, Improviser B, already in the area makes an offer. A and B have three lines to define who, what, and where they are before B has to find a justified reason to leave. Improviser B leaves, passing through the corridor to the other space, where Improviser C waits to make an offer. You can do this with two lines of improvisers feeding each playing space. Example: A steps into scene. B says,&quot;Young man, do you know what time it is?&quot; A replies, &quot;I&apos;m sorry Dad, I won&apos;t come home this late again.&quot; B Says, &quot;I think your Mother should hear that, I&apos;ll go get her.&quot; B leaves to go to the other playing area through the corridor.</description>

Improviser is then brought back to the stage where he is endowed to perform the 5 activities. The activities should be unrelated BUT the improvisers should attempt to incorporate the activities into a linear narrative. The scene is most successful if the person trying to guess the activities does whatever comes to mind. It is up to the improvisers &quot;in the know&quot; to guide the one guessing. Again, this is not a game of charades. Never forget narrative.</description>

    <description>Imagine that the stage is a large disk, balanced on a single point. As an improviser moves around on the stage, the balance of the stage is effected. Improvisers must compensate for each other’s movements, making sure that the stage is always balanced.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant name="Hero/Chorus">Improvisers stand in a circle (the disc). One of the improvisers steps onto the disc. He is now the HERO. He moves about the disc not speaking but playing his status. When he stops, someone else steps onto the disc to become the new HERO. The old HERO is now the CHORUS. When the New HERO stops, the CHORUS rushes to balance the disc opposite the HERO. At some point, the CHORUS decides not to move. When the CHORUS refuses to move, another HERO steps onto the disc, and the former HEROES join the CHORUS, moving to balance the HERO. Remember, the HERO and CHORUS cannot move at the same time, the chorus must wait for the HERO to stop. The CHORUS will decide not to move without consultation. They simply will not move. If one member of the CHORUS moves, then all must move. The CHORUS, when even in number can spilt into different combinations to balance the stage. For instance, a CHORUS of 6 could split into two groups 3, three groups of 2, six individuals, or remain as 6 person CHORUS. If the CHORUS is an odd number, they must stay whole. It is important to remember that the entire CHORUS is equal to one HERO. The game is about status being given, not taken. You can&apos;t be the HERO, if the CHORUS won&apos;t let you, and you can&apos;t be in the CHORUS till you&apos;ve been the HERO.</variant>

    <name>Give and Take</name>
    <description>Step 1: Improvisers spread out through a playing space then freeze in a position. One improviser begins to move about the room in any fashion they wish. They then give the momentum to another improviser who takes it immediately and begins to move about the room. When the second person begins to move, the first person freezes. Remember to &quot;give&quot; focus.

Step 2: Same as above, but in addition, the momentum may be &quot;taken&quot; by anyone who decides to move. If an improviser begins to move, the present &quot;mover&quot; freezes. If two people begin to move at the same time, they should mirror each other, or one of them has to give focus. It is very important to be aware of the people around you and if someone is in a difficult position give them the focus.</description>

    <name>Growing and Shrinking Machine</name>
    <description>Like Freeze Tag. Start with Improviser 1 on stage. Improviser 2 freezes the scene, jumps on stage and begins a new scene with Improviser 1. Same for Improvisers 3 and 4. Unlike Freeze Tag, improvisers do not tag out of the scenes. Eventually, the entire team will be on stage (let’s say 4 for example). Then!!! Improviser 4 must find a justifiable reason to leave the stage and the scene reverts back to the original 3-person scene, but time has passed, the improvisers are in new positions WHICH MUST BE JUSTIFIED. Then Improviser 3 finds a justifiable reason to leave the stage - back to the 2-person scene. Finally, Improviser 2 leaves - back to the solo scene. It is important to justify the new positions during the Shrinking phase of the game, not to simply jump into the original scene at the next moment.</description>

        <variant>Shrink then Grow by beginning with 5 improvisers then one leaves and thus begins a 4-person scene all the way down to one. Then the machine grows by having the improvisers enter the scene in order again up to the 5-person scene.</variant>

    <description>A fill in the blank scene involving super heroes and sinister villains.  BLANK Man/Woman is the main hero. Dr. BLANK is the main villain. BLANK is the sidekick to the hero and Mr./Ms BLANK is the sidekick to the villain. The VICTIMS are the rest of the players who set up the environment that soon becomes villain-ized. The players are strongly urged to get the full benefit of their given blank-name by incorporating all of the associations justifiably in the scene. FOR EXAMPLE, if the suggestions are, &quot;pancake, oven, wax, tree, and Starbucks&quot; then, Pancake Man and his sidekick Oven may fight against Dr. Wax and his sidekick Mr. Tree as they plot to turn all the coffee beans of the world to wax.  Pancake Man battles using his special flipping and flattening abilities as Oven melts off the wax.... etc... you get the idea.

This fun game was developed by Jay Hitt as a way to get improvisers to know their parts in a scene. To play it successfully, players must focus on the RELATIONSHIPS between their fellow improvisers.</description>

Each hand takes a turn patting the ground once around the  circle in order. Direction is changed when a player pats one hand twice and the order must go in the opposite direction. If a player makes a mistake, then the offending hand is eliminated from the circle. The game is over when one player remains.</description>

    <description>Two improvisers from opposing teams put on hats of approximately equal dimensions. Scene ends when one improviser (a) grabs the hat off his opponents head or (b) tries to grab the opponents hat and misses. Play the scene for reality. A Hat grab, the move to grab a hat or defend a hat, needs to be justifiable within the scene. The scene is often played with a 15 second &quot;window&quot; at the beginning in which improvisers cannot go for the hats.</description>

You have all the space and air you need, and have a great interest in what people have to say. Have the improvisers replay the scene and watch the results. The scene will generally be much more interesting to watch. This exercise is a good mantra to use when you are on stage as well.</description>

Improviser 2, &quot;He said, standing up and putting his hands on his hips.&quot; Improviser 1 carries out that physical action as improviser 2 continues, &quot;All right.&quot; Then Improviser 1 responds, &quot;She said, pulling out her bullwhip and snapping it over his head.&quot; Improvisers refer to each other in third person, to keep the narrative strong. The idea, like every other improv scene, is to endow your partner with do-able action. It gives the improvisers an excellent view on how to endow.</description>

    <description>One or more characters in the scene are invisible to each other. The other improvisers respond 1) as if they are visible (with no actor, like in Harvey) 2) as if they are invisible, but audible (voice provided by miked improviser off stage), or 3) as if they are invisible and inaudible (with an actor playing a ghost as in Blythe Spirit).</description>

    <name>Just a Minute</name>
    <description>This scene begins with a group of improvisers (usually four) standing in a line. Facing them is another improviser who acts as the Judge. The improvisers select a general topic of discussion, a one-minute timer is started, and the judge picks one person to start talking about that topic. The person talking can speak of an actual experience in that topic, they can make up a story around the theme, they can state facts about that topic; anything they want. The other improvisers try to challenge the speaker on ANY grounds. Challenges can be for repetition, boredom, off the topic, anything at all. The clock stops and the Judge decides if the challenge is valid or not. If the challenge is not valid, the clock and the speaker continue. However if the challenge is upheld, the challenger gets the floor, and begins speaking on the same topic. The challenging continues, if someone who has started their story, gets the floor back, they must continue with the same story they were telling when they lost the floor. The improviser talking at the end of the one minute time limit wins. This game is not a narrative game and should be played for fun.</description>

    <name>King Game</name>
    <description>One improviser is the King and one improviser is the Servant. The two play a scene; if at any time the King is dissatisfied with the Servant, he claps his hands and the Servant instantly dies, replaced by a new Servant. You may wish to time the Servants to see how long they last. This game is for learning how to be a good servant. You assume most people will put up with you, but being a servant is an acquired skill. If as servant you make mistakes, but the king enjoys being on stage with you, then you’re learning good servant skills. If you can keep the person onstage involved, then you can keep the audience involved as well. Kings are annoyed by open ended offers like, &quot;What shall we do now?&quot; They like specific things to do, &quot;Time for your tea, just the way you like it, Sir,&quot; is a more solid offer. Kings will sometimes kill for no reason at all, but the game is still worthwhile.</description>

    <description>Players stand in a circle, one player stands in the center and is “it”. The player goes to someone in the circle and says, “Kitty wants a corner,” and the player responds, “Go see my neighbor.” Indicating one direction or another. The player then moves to the next person in the circle and the direction and asks the question again to the receive the same response, etc.  While this is taking place, players standing in the circle establish eye contact with each other and then quickly change places. The “Kitty” in the center tries to get to someone’s spot before  it is filled. If he succeeds, then the person who didn’t make it becomes it.</description>

    <description>Animals: A list of animals is gathered from the audience. One improviser calls out different animals during the scene (or one improviser calls per on stage improviser) Improvisers on stage then play the scene as if they were a human with the animal&apos;s characteristics.

Attitudes/Emotions: Get list of attitudes and/or emotions from the audience. Make sure they vary; most audiences will readily supply hostile/active attitudes and emotions. Improvisers onstage begin the scene in neutral, then shift the scene as an off stage improviser calls out attitudes or emotions from the list. On stage improvisers must justify the rapid changes in attitude or emotion.  AKA Emotional Roller Coaster.

Genres: Get a list of genres from the audience (styles of...books, TV styles, plays, movies, paintings, etc). Play the scene in the different styles as the scene progresses.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant>May be played with one improviser remaining &quot;neutral&quot; and the others taking on the emotional characteristics.</variant>
        <variant>Each performer has their own separate item called out.</variant>
        <variant name="Double Lists">A list scene where two lists are used to change the improvisers in a single scene. For instance, Emotions and Film Styles, a scene begins neutral, then the emotion &quot;Happy&quot; is called. The scene becomes &quot;Happy&quot;, after awhile, the film style &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; is called. The scene becomes a &quot;Happy, Sci-Fi&quot; scene, if the emotion changes to &quot;Sad&quot;, then the scene becomes a &quot;Sad Sci-Fi&quot; scene. If the film style changes to &quot;Film Noir&quot;, it becomes a &quot;Sad, Film Noir&quot;, etc. Take your time with this game and make the transitions slowly.</variant>
        <variant name="Potpourri Lists">A list scene that incorporates many of the items from the above lists. For instance, you may have a single list with things like an animal, a film style, a playwright, an emotion, etc. So improvisers would shift from the emotion, &quot;Sadness&quot;, to the film genre, &quot;Western&quot; in the same scene.</variant>

    <name>Lotus</name>
    <description>A series of scenes in which each scene develops out of the &quot;dynamics&quot; of the previous scene. An audience suggestion is not used. Three playing areas are established on stage, usually with a pair of actors in each area. One couple begins a scene from nothing. When the second group feels that they have determined the dynamic of the first scene, they begin their own scene with different characters in a different place using their interpreted dynamic from the first group. Then group three repeats the process.

The rotation is then completed two more times, for a total of 9 &quot;scenes&quot;. Each time the cycle begins again, the groups use the characters they established in their own first scene, but the scenes need not be chronologically correct.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant name="Solo">in which three individuals take the stage doing monologues. Again, it starts as a scene from nothing - the second improviser determines the dynamic and each actor gets 3 shots at his character.</variant>

    <name>Making Faces</name>
    <description>Three Improvisers sit shoulder to shoulder, the one in the middle is the master, the outer two are the servants. The master is planning a gathering and is giving the servants orders.  He may only speak to one servant at a time. When the master is not looking at them the servants make faces behind his back, trying not to get caught. If the master catches them, he fires them instantly and they are replaced with another servant. The idea is for the servants to take bigger and bigger risks with making faces. If they play it safe the audience will lose interest. They want to see the servants misbehave. The master should play this strictly, showing no mercy, to create a sense of danger.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant>Add chairs to the outer servants and continue to play the game that when the person next to you is not looking, you should make faces. You may keep adding people to the outer edge.</variant>

    <name>Mantra Scene</name>
    <description>Play a scene in which the improvisers have a hidden mantra that they keep repeating to themselves and try to embody during the scene. If the mantra is &quot;I love you&quot;, the character should try to play &quot;I love you&quot; with everything they do. Everything is played with the hidden objective. To teach this scene, have two improvisers play a neutral scene. Ask them to recite, to themselves, the first line of a familiar nursery rhyme. Ask them to respond to questions as they keep the rhyme running in their heads. They should have problems responding to the questions. Next, have them play their neutral scene again, this time with a &quot;I love you&quot; or &quot;I hate you&quot; mantra. The key to the mantra scene is to play the mantra truthfully within the context of the scene. If your mantra is &quot;I love you&quot;, you should show your love in actions and what you say, you should always TRY to say &quot;I love you&quot; in everything you say, but only say &quot;I love you&quot; if you can do it truthfully in the context of the scene. Some basic mantras are; &quot;I love you&quot;, &quot;I hate you&quot;, &quot;I want to sleep with you&quot;, &quot; I want nothing&quot;, &quot;I&apos;m better than you.&quot;, etc. The list of possibilities is endless. After some time, you may want to work with more complex mantras, such as &quot;I love you, but I want you to go&quot;, &quot;I hate you, but I want to sleep with you&quot;, etc. Again the possibilities are endless. Eventually, you may play a mantra combined with an objective, such as, &quot;I hate you, but I&apos;m pregnant&quot;, or &quot;I love you, but I&apos;m going to kill you&quot;, etc. Try to avoid falling into a &quot;talking heads&quot; scene.</description>

    <description>Three improvisers are onstage. Without speaking, they leave together for the same reason. Go with the first simple offer - don&apos;t try to be original. A twitch or throat clearing can evolve into a reason to leave. Beginners will always try to be clever, instead of letting the reason evolve. Don&apos;t reject anything, use it to develop a reason to leave. After playing this for a while, introduce dialogue. Improvisers may talk, but can&apos;t leave for the reason they’re discussing.</description>

    <name>Moving Bodies</name>
    <description>Audience members or teammates provide the locomotion for the improvisers on stage. Improvisers may not move any part of their own bodies (except to provide dialogue by moving their mouths). Movers should put the &quot;puppets&quot; in challenging positions and puppets should challenge the puppeteers with their verbal endowments.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant name="Mutual Moving Bodies">Like regular Moving Bodies with one notable exception, all the movers are in the scene. Improviser A moves Improviser B, Improviser B moves Improviser C, Improviser C moves Improviser A. When a character onstage has to move another character, they simply break their position, move the other character, then resume their position to be moved.</variant>
        <variant name="Puppets a la Ruse">Moving Bodies with a twist, when the &quot;puppets&quot; are moved, they continue to move with their momentum until sent into another direction, or stopped. If the mover taps the puppets arm, that arm begins to move in slow motion. If the arm is not stopped, or tapped in another direction, the movement would begin to affect the whole body. For instance, if tapped outward, the arm would eventually begin pulling the whole body outward in that direction. The whole scene generally takes on a &quot;weightless&quot; quality, with puppets floating through the air.</variant>
        <variant name="Moving Boxes">The stage chairs, which are often black boxes, become the &quot;floor&quot; and a player moves the floor as the improviser walks on it. The mover&apos;s ultimate job is to take care of the improviser above and keep him from falling.</variant>

    <name>One Hit Wonders</name>
    <description>Many games are primarily &quot;one hit wonders,&quot; gag scenes which are rarely as interesting the second time around in the same show or sometimes ever. The team performing second is usually at a disadvantage as the scene&apos;s novelty has worn off. Might try taking three of these wonders (eg: Boris, Arms, Sideways Scene, etc) writing them on a slip of paper and picking one from a hat.</description>

    <description>Each improviser gets an emotion. As they enter the party, the emotion of the party changes. As each person leaves, the emotion returns to the previous improvisers (kind of an emotional Growing and Shrinking Machine). People can enter and leave as many times as is justifiable. Emotions may be played as &quot;instantly transforming&quot; the scene, or more subtly.</description>

    <name>Pecking Order</name>
    <description>Status game. Each improviser picks a number corresponding to the number of improvisers on stage (e.g. if there are three people on stage, all improvisers pick a number between 1 - 3). Improvisers don&apos;t tell each other what number they have chosen for themselves, so it is conceivable that all improvisers might choose the same number. #1 is considered the highest status. The highest number (going back to the previous example, would be &quot;3&quot;) is considered the lowest status. Scene is played with improvisers projecting their own status - one does what one must to demonstrate to the others the status they have chosen. Scenes are most interesting when more than one person chooses the same number. One person may play &quot;1&quot; the way someone else plays &quot;3&quot;. The status may also be given in secret to each improviser by an improviser not in the scene.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant name="Pecking Order with Hats">Played as Pecking Order, except that the improvisers wear their numbers on hats. If a 2 is able to grab 1&apos;s hat then they switch pecking positions. So a 4 could work his way to the 1 position by the end of the scene. When playing this scene, don&apos;t worry about the hats, if it&apos;s going to be taken let it be taken. The fun is in trying to get it back.</variant>

    <name>Phone Bank</name>
    <description>Improvisers begin the scene as if they are standing in front of a bank of pay telephones - at a public location. Each improviser may ask the audience for a professional problem, or an emotion, or an object, etc. The first improviser steps up to a phone, calls someone, and begins a conversation that relates to the suggestion from the audience. After the tone and rhythm of the conversation is established, improviser 2 does the same thing. Improviser 1 fades out of the conversation for a while. After improviser 2 is established, improviser 3 calls someone, etc. This process continues until all the improvisers are on the phone. At this point, improvisers trade the focus of the scene back and forth, using words, phrases, emotions, etc from each other’s conversations in order to temporarily take the focus of the scene. Gradually, each improviser hangs up. The scene should be played like a chamber music piece: volume changes, speed of conversation changes, rapidity of people taking focus changes, etc.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant name="Lecture">Two experts stand shoulder to shoulder on stage. They each get a topic to discuss. They both begin to lecture on their topic, speaking at the same time and ignoring the other expert. As the lecture continues they begin to pick up on each others words, etc, as in Phone Bank.</variant>

    <name>Poison Arm Samurai</name>
    <description>The outer edge off your forearms, from elbow to pinky, is a poison sword which can be used to kill and to defend. Improvisers stand in a circle and move their arms up and down in slow motion. Once an even rate is established, the &quot;GO!&quot; is given. The improvisers go at each other trying to hit each other anywhere on the body with their poison sword. The only defense being that persons own sword. If hit anywhere other than the outer edge of the forearm, that person dies in slow motion. A dying samurai may continue to kill until their rump touches the ground. The point of this game is to be aware and in control of your body. Focus on keeping your body moving at the same rate. You want to follow through on your actions, you&apos;re not moving slowly, you&apos;re moving in slow motion. If you swing and miss, follow through with your arm movement, even if it means being killed. Once you&apos;ve mastered this, try playing in teams of two, remembering that you can accidentally kill your partner.</description>

    <description>A group of improvisers enter a playing area speaking gibberish. They are at a reunion, not having seen each other for quite some time. After a few minutes of catching up in their native language, they gather in a circle and begin to sing gibberish songs they all know. Each person, or small groups, may step into the circle and sing a verse or dance a native dance. When the songs end, they all say good-bye, then leave.</description>

    <description>Several improvisers stand onstage and an actual song title is taken from the audience. An improviser begins to sing that song. They can stop on any word. Once they stop, another improviser has five seconds to begin another actual song that has that word in the title. They can bluff and try to make up a song with that word in it. If they take too long, or the audience doesn’t believe the made up song they yell, “Die” and the improviser is eliminated. However, if the song actually exists then another improviser (from the other team, etc.) is eliminated. Best played if the song has to start on the word: Improviser 1“You are my sunshine…….” Improviser 2“….sunshine of my life and I’ll always….”</description>

After all three lines have been heard, the singers weave words and phrases in and out of each other’s lines, creating new lines. Similar to Phone Bank. Singers trade focus, harmonies, tempos, words, etc.</description>

    <name>Timed Scene</name>
    <description>A scene that takes place in a specific amount of time (Deaths In A Minute, Epic In A Minute, Two Minute Status Transfer, etc.). Or the scene can be played in the time it takes to complete an activity (Scene That Takes Place in the Same Amount of Time It Takes to Recite the Alphabet Backwards, In The Time It Takes To Walk Around the Theater Five Times, Player to Shave, etc). The key is to find the most appropriate method of timing that will serve the scene and not simply be a gag.</description>

Who&apos;s there? Continue to ask them what they see and have them describe it in detail. They shouldn&apos;t have to choose anything, simply use their strong imaginations.</description>

    <name>What Comes Next?</name>
    <description>An improviser takes the stage and asks, &quot;What happens first?&quot;, then does whatever the audience has replied, then they ask “What comes next?”. The goal is to create narrative. This works best if you show the audience that blocking or clever suggestions will get them nowhere. If you train the audience to do this, they will understand it&apos;s a skill. If the audience groans at a suggestion, go back and get a different suggestion.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant>This game can also be played with a committee of four or five giving the suggestions. The committee will usually feel pressured and make wimpy choices. If the audience feels the committee has failed, the committee may be replaced. The committee should take their time and try to get into trouble. Demand that the first eight or nine suggestions be positive and advance the story. They want to set a routine and then break it, not delay it.</variant>

    <name>One Word Story</name>
    <description>Improvisers stand in a circle. They begin to tell a story a word at a time around the circle.</description>
    <variations>
        <variant name="Mutants">Two improvisers tell a story, alternating one word at a time, acting out the action of the story as it is told. Story should be kept in the present tense so that action is accomplished rather than talked about.</variant>
        <variant>Have the mutant narrate a story that is acted out by other improvisers.</variant>
        <variant name="Step Word Scene">A verbal restriction scene. Scene begins with a 1 word sentence. Next sentence has two words. Then three. Proceeds up to a 10 word sentence, then to a 9 word sentence. Back to a final 1 word sentence.</variant>
        <variant name="Step Word Story">A combination of One Word Story, and Step Word Scene. Improvisers tell a story around a circle. The first time around the circle each improviser is allowed one word. The second time around, they are allowed two words, then three, etc. up to five. Then descend from five to one word circles. When the circle finishes the cycle the story should end. Again that pattern is 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1-end</variant>
        <variant>Offstage player calls out numbers at random and that’s how many words each improviser uses.</variant>
        <variant name="Word at a Time Expert">An area of expertise is asked of the audience. Several improvisers are picked to speak as an expert in that field. They answer questions, show slides, etc. speaking alternately one word at a time. Often done as a Talk Show, another teammate plays the talk show host.</variant>
        <variant>Have an audience member sit between two improvisers as the expert.</variant>
        <variant name="Word at a Time Scene">Like Mutants, except each improviser plays a separate character. If one character speaks, the dialogue is provided by all the improvisers onstage - a word at a time. It is vital in this scene to have strong character voices for each person in the scene, since all the actors onstage are providing dialogue, the voices serve to distinguish the characters from one another.</variant>
        <variant name="Word Ball">Improvisers stand in a circle. One improviser &quot;tosses&quot; any word they want to anybody else in the circle, that person in turn &quot;tosses&quot; another free associated word to another person in the circle. This warm up should be played at a fast pace and the improvisers should not think ahead, simply free associate on the word they&apos;re tossed.</variant>

        <variant name="Words, Sounds, Silence">In one quadrant, improvisers may speak, in another they may make noises, in the third, they are silent. </variant>

    <description>Several improvisers line up and a product category is taken form the audience such as cars or furniture polishes. When the MC points at one of the improvisers, they must come up with a fictitious brand name for the item or the audience yells, “Die”.

Played until only one improviser is left. Best played if sentences are not allowed. For instance a fictitious furniture polish named “Shine Bright” is acceptable while “Gee, my furniture looks terrific” is not.</description>
